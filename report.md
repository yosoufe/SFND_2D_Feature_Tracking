## MP1 - Data Buffer
This is required for long data stream of images. The following code section would implement a std::vector that 
its size would never get larger than the specified values `dataBufferSize`, here 2. When the size is smaller than `dataBufferSize` frame is being added normally. But when the buffer full, first the frames in the buffer are copied 
to the location with one index less and then the new frame is being copied two the end of the buffer.
```c++
DataFrame frame;
frame.cameraImg = imgGray;
if (dataBuffer.size() < dataBufferSize)
{
    dataBuffer.push_back(frame);
} else
{
    for ( auto it = dataBuffer.begin() ; it != dataBuffer.end()-1 ; it++ )
    {
        *it = *(it+1);
    }
    dataBuffer[dataBufferSize - 1] = frame;
}
``` 
The benefit is that it would follow the same api of normal `std::vector` it would not be
required to change the rest of the code to access the data. While the disadvantage is that
if the `dataBufferSize` would be large, then a lot of data copy would be required which would 
not be ideal. In this case, 
[Circular Buffer from Boost library](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/circular_buffer.html) 
is highly recommended.
